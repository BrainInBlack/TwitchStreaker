# TwitchStreaker for Streamlabs Chatbot

This plugin was initially created for the Twitch-Streamer [AnEternalEnigma](http://twitch.tv/AnEternalEnigma) to keep track of new and gifted subscriptions to his channel, counting towards a goal (Streak). After completing a Streak a new one gets started right away, again counting towards the same goal.

## Installation

1. Create a folder called "TwitchStreaker" in the ```Chatbot > Services > Scripts``` directory.
2. Clone this Repo in the newly created folder.
3. In Chatbot, open the Scripts Tab and click the ```Reload Scripts``` button.
4. Right click on the ```TwitchStreaker``` script and click ```Insert API Key```.
5. Enter your ```Twitch Account Name``` and the amount of subs required per streak.
6. Add the [Overlay.html](Overlay.html) as Browser Source to your scene in your preferred streaming

## Customization

Currently restructuring the whole project, meaning we can't guarantee a reliable way to customize the Overlay yet, but it will come back soon.
